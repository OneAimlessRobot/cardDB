The stages of numbness;
Wimpy, pathetic and miserable;
Maidcore;
I hate sadness. I hate that Im sad and the fact that other people dont let me be sad. I have no motivation, the girls think I am a wimp, my teachers think I am lazy, my parents thing I am lazy and my friends think I am a pathetic loser. All of them are sucessful and cool and I am just a loser! Why cant I just stop being like this! Its painful and bad!;
The devil's syrup (the solution!);
Maidcore;
The devil hears the loser boy's incessant pleading and self mourning. Tells him: "you are not dead my son! just... ignore it! its all just useless banter diferent corners of your brain are having! If you ignore it all will be fine! trust me! and believe me! The boy tries some of the dreaded syrup. He realises: You are soo right! Ever since I started, I am sucessful, I am motivated, the girls look at me, the boys laugh with, not at me, the teachers praised me... this is amazing! Thank you!;
The spoils of the numbness and ignorance;
Maidcore;
I live! I laugh! I have fun! This is so cool! I finally have clarity! I can work and have sucess! The girls flirt with me! I feel so free! Summer love is good! I feel so freeeeeee! My reason is unparalleled, I am responsible. My parents compare my siblings to me, not the other way around! My crush noticed me! My motivation is unstoppable! I am almost... Godly! I am not weak anymore! Im not a weak loser anymore! I changed! I am different! I will never ever give up now! My life is the best out there!;
Cracks? I fixed them! I fix them! I am indestructible!;
Maidcore;
Sometimes, I wonder: "Does any of this actually matter?" "Why am I even doing any of this?" "I am now reasonable. And?" But I learned to ignore them like it told me! I learned that partying is the real solution to all of this! If I drink until I passout and get hospitalized, my friends will praise me even more! And my brain will get so strong that I can barely read it! The thoughts move by so fast! And my grades keep improving! And I started to speak with this girl who I think  Im in love with! She even said that I am a true 10/10!!!!! Im so happy with myself!;
The thoughts got stronger... Its fine! Right...?;
Maidcore;
The thoughts get stronger and more confusing everyday... I started dreaming of my old life... I fear I am... becoming a loser..
 again...? I am not a loser! I cant be! I just have to work harder! I had dropped all my bad habits... exept one! I still drew porn cartoons, (that I kept hidden, of course) that included this girl named "Tipo". Thats embarassing, you are right... but... who said that? Not me, right? Thats still what losers do? who Said that????!!!!! I did not hear anyone!!!!! People cant know that I am a crazy lunatic that draws porn and self pampers! no one must know! Ill work harder! and harder! AND HARDER!;
I masturbated for 10 hours straight. And i am not even ashamed. and it felt good.;
Maidcore;
I dont know what to say... Am  I still not cool? How can people do this? Anyway, Ill work harder... right? RIGHT! I HAVE TO OVERCOME THE WEAKNESS! I AM STRONG! I AM STRONG! You are not ignoring yourself enough, Adriano! Stop pampering yourself! Never show emotion! Thats what losers do! Specially not Anger like a disgusting incel! Or melancholy like a pathetic emo goth femboy! got it?! Ok... Everything is good!;
Whats a thought? What is an emotion? Arent they the same?;
Maidcore;
I cant feel my limbs... I cant feel my face... Im just a moth aimlessly looking for light... I dont feed myself, I dont pamper myself... I just have strong thoughts and stuff... right? But my core is burning with the acid of my repressed weakness...This must... stop. Now.;
This is where I face my useless thoughts... with facts!;
Maidcore;
Go away! I am not wimp!!!! Not a wimp, not a wimp, not a wimp!!!!! The girls cant see me as a coward who says edgy shit! A pathetic non-religious atheist nihilist cringelord!!!!! I am not a loser! I cant... let my mind... take control... Ok... it said these pills in case I lose, right? I wont lose though... It believes it me! I cant let it down!;
Mother... is proud of me? Also... Father? They are not here. But... they are telling me... Its a dead end... Where are they? I hurt... everywhere...;
Maidcore;
Son. Run away. Its okay. Run away. Run away to where people accept you. Keep running. Dont stop. When you reach the coast, smell the fish you shall feed on, the wet wood of the docks where boats that take you to distant lands shall park (or whatever boats do), the people with whom you will have beautiful adventures. Its okay... to suffer, its okay, to feel like making a fit, because life is unfair. Its okay... to simply not be happy with life. Its also okay and normal... to suck at it. Wake up. Wake up to a new kind of happiness... And... Im sorry. Good bye son. Have a nice trip wherever you decide to go.;
Title: End of the road.;
Maidcore;
I cant take this anymore. Its too mutch!!!! My thoughts... cant tell apart anger from sadness I was not built to be that way. sorry everyone. I am not strong like you. goodnight world....;

Yakui the Maid - Radiostalking (vocal cover);
Maidcore;
My spine is an antenna, my hair spikes up when near them, I get rash from the panic, I sweat and cry and blush and hyperventilate. My consciousness pours straight out of me and into the minds of them! Nothing is sacred or private anymore! I sit alone in my room and they know! I masturbate and they know! I am an incel and they know! The stream of consciousness flowing out of me is broadcasted to everyone else. It is broadcasted to the entire village! I am the emo school shooting weirdo! "Excuse me... that is offensive! I never even picked up a gun before! Can you stop calling me a school shooter on twitter, please?" "But... you are!" "Why?" "See? your even too dumb to notice! He is a lost cause guys! Just ignore him!" Ok idk what to type here, I dont know if this is real... I am just over dramnatic... Everyone is depressed... and stuff I am not special... My struggles are not real... whatever just gonna send it...;

Tortricidae - Yakui the Maid (Rap cover);
Melancholy in the background, dissing misery in the foreground. And one hell of a good time.;
Ok. Listen carefully, as I am tired of telling this to myself (as I keep forgetting). This is for all the spineless moths and mere survivors of this world! Sing with me so you can realise your dreams and not be turned into a pack by your regrets! 3... 2... 1!!!! From Lourinha to Lisbon its allways been the same! Shaving away at happiness to give myself the illusion of duty! Yeah, then weep in agony as I forget all my past traditions and gratitude (who told you being happy was hard?). I realised a long time ago that your brain is allways correct and your best friend! But thats at 25 celsius! Its basically a huge lie and I can prove it! It basically just involves this simple process: Be quiet. Does your brain stop when you ask it to? Do you stop suffering when It gets  to just the right temperature? Of course not! To stop merely existing, ignore your most basic desires! Drop them! Ive learned Moths are symbols of melancholy because all they do is chase brighter and brighter lights! To get to your core, shave everything off! All that you dont need! And then watch as you move around like a hunter gazele! Jump! Run! Work! Play! All with less weight to carry! Better bang for your buck, yeah! Become dragonflies! Are you ready to die, now?;
